You rely on predictions every day: you might check the weather app before choosing your outfit or peek at the traffic before starting your commute. Perhaps you are responsible for setting your organization’s strategy in the future. Do you find yourself wondering how accurate predictions are, how you can see into the future, and why the weatherman always seems to be wrong? In our Error and Uncertainty course, you’ll make some predictions yourself, learn to distinguish real differences from random noise, and explore psychological crutches we use that interfere with our rational decision making. You will uncover patterns in Seattle crime data, predict students’ final grades, prevent Nashville traffic accidents, and determine whether a bakery’s menu needs to change. Join us! We’re certain you’ll enjoy learning about error and uncertainty.
